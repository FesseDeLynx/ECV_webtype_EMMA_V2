        <h4>The project</h4>
   <p>This is a research project on readability and accessibility, based on the <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> siteweb which is an online library of free ebooks. The aim was to create an environment where people can comfortably read a book on a website. I personally chose a classic 19th century English novel written by Jane Austen. I am interested in reading original works to improve my English, so that I don't lose the nuances of the writing through translation, and Jane Austen's Emma was highly recommended.</p>

   <h4>A little summary of the book</h4>
    <p>Emma Woodhouse lives alone with her sick father. Rich, beautiful and intelligent, she is the mistress of the house and will take it into her head to play matchmaker for a young girl, Harriet Smith, whom she takes in. These encounters will not necessarily turn out to her advantage. A novel that takes place in the social circles of the nobility and bourgeoisie of the early 19th century in England. You can find the original html novel on the <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/158/158-h/158-h.htm">Project Gutenberg</a> web site and if you're interested in Jane Austen, here is her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen">Wikipedia</a> page.</p>

<h4>Typography</h4>
<p>Averything is set in a serif font, the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nanum+Myeongjo?query=nanum">Nanum Myeongjo</a>, exept for the body copy and subtitles, they are set in a variable sans-serif font, the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mont">Montserrat</a>, both from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>. The serif font give a classical feel which goes well with the atmosphere of the 19th century, while the sans-serif brings a more modern feel. </p>

<h4>Readability & accessibility</h4>
<p>For readability, I wanted to have a minimum of colours, and no images, to have the impression of the most classic book you can have on a website. I tried to have an easy-to-use and ergonomic interface, with everything on the front-end for optimal navigation, especially on tablets where I think people are most willing to read long texts. The text and the interface adapt as much as possible to the different screen sizes. The font sizes, as well as the placement of the navigation tools, change place and size according to the reading situation.
    
For accessibility reasons, I wanted to have as many text buttons as possible for navigation. The only pictographic button is the return to the top of the page, which is an up arrow created in CSS. The site adapts to the light or dark preference mode of the user system, or can be changed manually if preferred. The colours used are slightly off-white, even cream, as well as blacks tending towards grey to limit the aggressiveness of the light on the eyes and to tire the user as little as possible. The only colour use is a light green to higlith the links of the site. I chose green because it is a fresh, relaxing and pleasing to the eye colour. It is the colour of nature. Green has a strong emotional link with safety. It is therefore the colour of spring, when everything comes to life. Which I spontaneously associate with the English countryside in which Jane Austen makes her characters live. </p>

<p>I had trouble with the construction of the site, not because of the html and css language, but more because of the lack of vision I had about the architecture. It was complicated to anticipate the interface and its use. Quite frustrating when something didn't work as expected, but even more satisfying when it did. I've learned a lot about accessibility and readability, even though I haven't been able to really optimize my site to the fullest, I think it's on the right track but my abilities are still limited and it takes a lot of time to get it right, which is still extremely frustrating. The light and dark mode took a lot of time and was difficult for me, but now I have mastered it! I'm still not sure I understand how the clamps works, but I've been applying them as best I can. As for media queries, I have understood their use and function, but I still have trouble using them. It took me too long to get to the point of setting my breakpoints, but they do exist. I'm also super happy today to know and be able to comfortably use a coding software and Github, which was a mystery to me.</p>

<h4>What still needs to be done</h4>
<p>To complete the project for publication on the web, a lot would be missing. I think that a better layout when the site is in phone version, because my knowledge of the grid being inexistent, my blocks take too much space. I would have liked to see the chapters navigation disappear for smaller screens, maybe a burger menu to give the maximum space to the text. I've had to tinker to make it work best with my limited knowledge, but it would be worth it to have something more suitable for reading on a phone. I also have to finish to formatted the text on the majority of the site.</p>

<p>I would like to be able to create an effect with the title "EMMA" on the  homepage, that it cuts off in the middle, when the screen shrinks. The problem is that with a span, without a space between the "EM" and the "MA", the cut does not happen, and I have not found, or understood, any solutions for this. I would also have liked to have an "easter egg" effect on the homepage, with the author's name hidden by "anonymous" and discovering Jane Austen's name only once you pass over it, to recall the fact that she had to publish her book anonymously because she was a woman. These last two points are not major flaws, so I didn't focus on them as much as on the others. If I have time I would like to do them, but also work more on the fonts and layout of the chapters to optimise readability, which can still be improved. </p>
